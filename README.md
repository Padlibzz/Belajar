# Coding Learning Repository 💻

Welcome to my learning repository! This repository serves as a place for me to store, track, and manage all the **assignments, mini-projects, and coding study notes** I create on my journey to master the world of programming.

The main goals of this repository are to:

* Record my learning progress in an organized manner.
* Store solutions to coding assignments and challenges.
* Serve as an initial portfolio of what I have learned.
